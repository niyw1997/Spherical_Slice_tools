**Spherical_Slice_tools** is an interactive program designed for extracting slices from astronomical images and studying atmospheric wave phenomena. Built on widely-used astronomical packages such as SunPy, Astropy, and SciPy, this tool allows users to manually select map coordinates of wavefronts after running the code, enabling the extraction of relevant information. Users are required to provide necessary map parameters and file paths, as demonstrated in the `aia_plt_demo.py` example.

**Example**:
```bash
> run slice_tools
> run aia_plt_demo
```
